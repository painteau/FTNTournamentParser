# FTNTournamentParser
Fortnites favorite assistent is here to help you parse replay files.

```python
from ray import Reader

with Reader("filepath") as replay:
    print(replay.stats)
    print(replay.team_stats)
    
    for elim in replay.eliminations:
        print(elim)

> âœ¨ Create a JSON object from a Fortnite replay file.

## Install

For now I haven't published this package to NPM as it isn't ready for prime time ðŸ™‰

```
$ git clone git@github.com:tpatel/fortnite-replay-reader.git
```

## Usage

For now you can only run the main executable without configuration (it always targets the hardcoded file from index.js).

```
$ node index.js
```

For the file `UnsavedReplay-2018.07.15-23.26.39.replay` from the `data/` directory, the parser returns the following JSON header:

```
{
  "MagicNumber": 480436863,
  "FileVersion": 5,
  "LengthInMS": {
    "ms": 227548,
    "string": "03:47"
  },
  "NetworkVersion": 2,
  "Changelist": 4200584,
  "FriendlyName": "Unsaved Replay",
  "IsLive": false,
  "Timestamp": "2018-07-15T23:26:39.637Z",
  "Compressed": true
}
```

You can also use the chunks data to list the player eliminations like in the following output:

```
00:06  [LordKirk3333] eliminated [Porco Ninja] [267]
00:09  [koÅ¼uch] eliminated [Cl_Ra_] [260]
